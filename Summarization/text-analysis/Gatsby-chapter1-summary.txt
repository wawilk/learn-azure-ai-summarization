Nick Carraway, a former Yale University student, is a self-proclaimed "responsibly tolerant" man. He was inspired by his father's advice to reserve judgement and to remember that not everyone has the same advantages. He moved to Long Island after the Great War and rented a house in West Egg, a strange community on the east coast. He had dinner with the Buchanans, his second cousin once removed, and his friend Tom. He describes the scene at the Buchanans' house, where he meets Daisy and Tom's new wife, Jordan Baker.
