Microsoft has been working to advance AI beyond existing techniques by taking a more holistic, human-centric approach to learning and understanding. The Chief Technology Officer of Azure AI services, who enjoys a unique perspective in viewing the relationship among three attributes of human cognition: monolingual text, audio or visual sensory signals, and multilingual, has created XYZ-code, a joint representation to create more powerful AI that can speak, hear, see, and understand humans better. Over the past five years, Microsoft has achieved human performance on benchmarks in conversational speech recognition, machine translation, conversational question answering, machine reading comprehension, and image captioning.
